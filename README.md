# RFID-attendance
A simple RFID attendance system that I made for my school's science fair. I used arduino and rfid reder to achieve this task.
The RFID reder read a card and send a unique code corresponding to that card to the arduino. The arduino then processes it and sends the code to the python code.

The Python program handles the code and corresponds it the specific person. It then alters an excel file to write down the person's name and the time he entered the school premises.
